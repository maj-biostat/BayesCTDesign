\title{Simulate a single randomized trial using a Lognormal outcome and information from
historical controls.}
\usage{
lognormaltrialsimulator(sample_size_val, histdata, mu1_val, mean_ratio_val,
  common_sd_val, censor_value, a0_val, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_size_val}{Number of subjects per arm.}

\item{histdata}{Dataset of historical data.  Historical datasets must have 4 columns:
id, treatment, event_time, and status.  The value of treatment should be 0.  The
values of event_time must be positive.  The values of status must be 0 (right
censored event) or 1 (observed event).}

\item{mu1_val}{Randomized control arm meanlog parameter used in call to \code{rlnorm()}.}

\item{mean_ratio_val}{Desired mean ratio between randomized experimental and control arms.}

\item{common_sd_val}{Randomized sdlog parameter used in call to \code{rlnorm()}.
Used in both randomized arms.}

\item{censor_value}{Value at which time-to-event data are right censored.}

\item{a0_val}{A power prior parameter ranging from 0 to 1, where 0
implies no information from historical data should be used, 1 implies all of
the information from historical data should be used.  A value between 0 and 1
implies that a proportion of the information from historical data will be used.}

\item{alpha}{A number ranging between 0 and 1 that defines the acceptable Type 1
error rate. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
\code{lognormaltrialsimulator()} returns a vector of simulation results. The
  first element is an estimated mean ratio, the second element is the estimated
  variance of the log mean ratio, and the third element is a 0/1 variable indicator
  whether or not the trial rejected the null hypothesis (1) or failed to reject
  the null hypothesis (0).
}
\description{
\code{lognormaltrialsimulator()} function only used internally by
\code{lognormal_sim()} function to run a single trial simulation involving historical
control data and a Lognormal outcome.
}
\details{
The simulation of a trial with a Lognormal outcome involving historical control data returns
an estimate of the mean ratio as well as an estimate of the log mean ratio variance.
Finally the simulation returns an indication of whether or not the simulated trial led to
a rejection of the null hypothesis (1) or not (0).

\code{lognormaltrialsimulator()} should not be called directly by user.
